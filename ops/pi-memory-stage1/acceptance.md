| 1   | Existing billing context expands to `pi_memory_stage1` in `usage-event.ts`, `usage-event-hourly-rollup.ts` and migrations 1141/1142. Capture preserves immutable org/user/original anchor and NULL run identities; raw anchor equals created time. | Real PostgreSQL writer/constraint tests reject incompatible inserts and owner/context/kind/run/time mutations. Old checks/capture are replayed in the scale validator before applying actual migrations.                                                                                        |
| 2   | `pi-memory-stage1-usage.service.ts` keeps the four category UUIDv5 keys and quantities. Retained complete legacy `runless` replay is immutable and inserts nothing; collisions fail closed. `billing-attribution.ts` recognizes the subtype.       | Legacy/cross-day/quantity/context cases and real operator audit; existing worker BYOK success/no-output/replay tests remain. No new key retention or second ledger; compaction still removes raw keys.                                                                                          |
| 3   | Existing compactor carries the new context in its physical grain. `v1/ledger.sql` reads raw + hourly with one snapshot and exact numeric arithmetic, original anchor and query-time price basis.                                                   | Infrastructure tests exercise actual compactor, repeat pass, true late raw addition/reconsolidation and concurrent repeatable-read snapshot. Existing compactor coverage protects genuine run/source deletion. Pending, billing errors, unknown prices and unattributed history remain visible. |
| 4   | `core/model-usage-cost.ts` computes the integer rational sum before category ceil/allowance. Cost observer shares canonical exact/alias pricing and writer cache-inclusive tier. USD divides by 1000.                                              | Pure pricing tests cover fractions, zero, missing/fallback/invalid rates and quantities; writer tests cover the tier boundary; real transport exercises an owned canonical alias and repricing. SQL verifies an integer above JS safe range. Historical /1250 assumptions remain unchanged.     |
| 5   | Worker records usage and observes cost before parse/commit handling. Runtime retains usage-bearing incomplete terminal responses. Original receipt identity/time separates first observations, replay and missing usage.                           | Worker suite covers existing output/no-output/commit/cancellation and admission fences; added incomplete-response persistence and logger-failure/no-paid-retry regressions. Logs can be lost and are not an exactly-once transactional journal.                                                 |
| 6   | `v1/definitions.json`, cost/health APL, fixture corpus and offline compiler define production-only, UTC-day >=20, 5-minute evaluation, original-response deduplication and previous-day reconciliation.                                            | Actual SDK NDJSON mapping plus independent local fixtures; repair #34433 adds exact-file production parser receipts and a real query-only corpus in `v1/validation.md`. Exact nano sums are bounded below the verified float precision limit, with explicit health on overflow.                 |
| 7   | Runbook requires actual reviewed notifier IDs, disabled monitor creation, authorized activation and bounded delivery after deployment, before C. Definitions are explicitly unactivated.                                                           | No live monitor, notifier, notification or repeated inventory probe. Existing 403 access gap and unknown destination remain explicit; all-off/no-data is not monitoring health.                                                                                                                 |
| 8   | 1141 expands NOT VALID checks/capture; 1142 validates in a separate transaction. Defaults remain 1s lock / 10s statement; permanent SQL inventory updated.                                                                                         | Full real schema comparison, snapshot chain and function inventory; 134426 raw + 321528 hourly current-schema scale fixture, mixed writers and exact query plan. Production counts came from two separate MaskDB snapshots; production lock contention/tag coverage remain unknown.             |
| 9   | Accepted source admission, frozen UTC slots, quota/credential pins, routing, budgets, watermarks/retries, Phase 2 and Storage code paths retain their contracts.                                                                                   | Targeted worker/runtime/compactor suites and diff/caller review. No feature/breaker changes, prices/allowances, release, probe, production SQL, cron, public UI, broad A2 or next-child work.                                                                                                   |
| 10  | One focused PR with same-owner `/pr-auto` and SHA-bound full tracked review; normal required CI and protected merge queue.                                                                                                                         | The PR's latest review and GitHub terminal state are authoritative. Owner stops after MERGED; controller independently accepts release/operations later.                                                                                                                                        |

## Implemented / adapted / improved

- **Implemented:** durable explicit attribution, one newly priced observation,
  exact daily SQL, versioned disabled cost/health definitions and activation runbook.
- **Adapted:** two migration transactions instead of an unsafe combined
  expansion/validation transaction; migrations regenerated after canonical #34234,
  #34272, #34273, #34304, #34317, #34263, #34305 and #34340 merged.
  Existing compaction and pricing resolution are reused without a new ledger.
- **Improved:** usage-bearing terminal failures remain observable; integer
  rational valuation and exact nano-USD aggregation protect the equality budget
  boundary; operator coverage and true late-row snapshot tests close attribution
  gaps. No billing price, rounding, allowance or historical report is changed.
- **CI recovery:** the capacity regression test uses real routes with a
  signal-owned upstream response barrier and joins every cancelled request.
  Production cache behavior, assertions and the default five-second limit remain
  unchanged. This same two-file repair is retained when integrating main's
  alternative fixture timing change.

## Remaining boundaries

The 20 USD figure is fractional gross credit value, not a provider invoice or
net credits. Logs and their bounded deduplication window do not prove complete
billing coverage. Sub-nano fractions or out-of-int64 observations remain priced
for display/SQL but report incomplete exact APL coverage. Current canonical token
unit sizes are representable; aggregate range is an activation check.

Post-deployment APL revalidation, missing-group recovery/delivery details, actual destination,
monitor activation, production labels/scale/locks, enabled-user runtime billing
and seven days below budget are unverified. These files leave PiMemory off for
everyone and the background breaker false. No production operation is delegated.

| 1   | Both exact APL files execute on production with non-partial 200 receipts in `v1/validation.md`. Typed NULL access supports absent D columns.                             | All-off is inactivity; ingestion completeness remains unproven.                                                           |
| 2   | `validate-apl.mjs` runs the actual files over `fixtures.json` plus `query-fixtures.mjs` using query-only typed tables.                                                   | No dataset ingest; the separate local oracle is not APL proof.                                                            |
| 3   | Explicit `arg_min` columns, fixed-width observation order and service-supported UTC strings pass all branches, ties, replay and rollover.                                | Bounded retention and late-data policy remain; aggregate precision outside the verified bound is unavailable with health. |
| 4   | Revision 2 definitions, offline disabled-body tests, field mapping, receipts and this runbook agree.                                                                     | Actual activation, destination and delivery remain controller gates.                                                      |
| 5   | Product repair stays in `ops/pi-memory-stage1`; one necessary Turbo safe-directory line follows the actual renamed checkout path. Runtime/DB/ledger files are unchanged. | Original D's other nine areas and all accepted fences retain their implementation.                                        |
| 6   | One focused repair PR, full current-SHA tracked review and normal PR/merge-group gates.                                                                                  | GitHub review and MERGED receipts are authoritative; no release follows from merge.                                       |
