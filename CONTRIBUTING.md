## Development Setup

Use the repository's [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) for Node.js, pnpm,
PostgreSQL, and the other development tools. Install Docker (or OrbStack on
macOS) and VS Code's Dev Containers extension, clone the repository, and open
`okou.code-workspace` with **Dev Containers: Open Workspace in Container**.

The supported Node and pnpm versions are declared in
[turbo/package.json](turbo/package.json). Install Git hooks with
`lefthook install` when configuring a new development checkout.

## Environment

Team members with the required 1Password access can use `scripts/sync-env.sh`.
For manual setup, copy the current templates from the repository root:

```bash
cp turbo/apps/api/.env.local.tpl turbo/apps/api/.env.local
cp turbo/apps/platform/.env.local.tpl turbo/apps/platform/.env.local
```

Replace the required `op://...` placeholders with your development credentials.
The templates describe the service-specific variables; Clerk supplies identity
and R2 supplies object storage. Generate a local `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with
`openssl rand -hex 32`. Do not commit local environment files or credentials.

Use `APP_URL=https://app.vm7.ai:8443` for the local Platform origin. Refer to
[the proxy guide](turbo/packages/proxy/README.md) for HTTPS, certificate tokens,
and public callback tunnel setup. Optional hosted sites use separate R2 hosted
site credentials and the `ZERO_HOST_DOMAIN` / `ZERO_HOST_SCHEME` settings from
the API template.

## Local Development

`scripts/prepare.sh` checks the local environment, syncs credentials, installs
dependencies, applies database migrations, and seeds development data. Use it
when setting up local development or repairing that environment; it is not a
prerequisite for documentation work.

To install dependencies and apply pending migrations separately:

```bash
cd turbo
pnpm install
pnpm -F @okouai/db db:migrate
```

Start the workspace development services from `turbo` with `pnpm dev`. For API
work requiring public callbacks, use `pnpm -F api dev`, which starts the API and
its development tunnel. The proxy routes the local surfaces as follows:

| Surface                       | Local HTTPS URL         | Direct HTTP port |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Platform                      | https://app.vm7.ai:8443 | 3002             |
| API                           | https://api.vm7.ai:8443 | 3001             |
| Marketing (separate checkout) | https://www.vm7.ai:8443 | 3042             |

The bare `vm7.ai:8443` host redirects to Marketing. See the
[Caddy configuration](turbo/packages/proxy/Caddyfile) for routing and the
[Desktop guide](turbo/apps/desktop/README.md) for packaged macOS development.

## Verification and Pull Requests

1. Branch from current `main`, implement a focused change, and inspect its diff.
2. Select checks for the changed files and consumers using
   [project verification](CLAUDE.md#development-and-verification).
3. For tests, use the matching [testing guide](docs/testing.md). Prefer package
   scope, such as `pnpm -F @okouai/app exec vitest run <test-file>` from `turbo`.
   Run only one Vitest process at a time. Do not make full-repository build or
   test runs the default for an isolated change.
4. Documentation changes need formatting, valid references, and any specialized
   consumers. Run broader checks only when the changed scope requires them.
5. Commit using [commitlint.config.mjs](commitlint.config.mjs), push the branch,
   and open a PR. Report local checks separately from CI and deployment state.
   Required protected checks must pass before merge.

For schema changes, use [database migrations](turbo/packages/db/MIGRATIONS.md)
and [database development](.claude/skills/database-development/SKILL.md). Do not
run production migrations as part of local setup.
