//! End-to-end: CLI cleanly exits on its own after `type=result`. The
//! agent either arms the reap deadline and then observes `child.wait()`,
//! or observes `child.wait()` first and keeps the FSM in Done so the
//! drained result event cannot re-arm it. Neither ordering sends SIGTERM
//! or SIGKILL.
//!
//! Guards against the regression "reap accidentally kills healthy CLIs"
//! by keeping the configured reap deadline beyond the test timeout and
//! asserting the mock result is observed and exits cleanly before that
//! deadline can fire.
