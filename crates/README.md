## Architecture and naming

```text
Runner -> guest-control-client -> guest-control-server (guest-init child)
Guest  -> runner-rpc-client    -> Runner service endpoint
Guest  -> process-control-ipc  -> guest-local process control / placement
```

Client/server names describe application calling roles, not socket initiation.
The guest opens the guest-control connection; Runner accepts it and calls guest
operations. The transport remains vsock forwarded through Firecracker Unix
sockets (or direct Unix sockets in integration tests). These services do not
implement a generic vsock protocol. Runner uses sandbox-firecracker through the
sandbox interfaces; guest-init remains PID 1 and embeds the control service in
its child. No new daemon or crate boundary is implied by these names.

A `guest-` package prefix is not an artifact inventory. The authoritative
[guest binary inventory](runner/guest-binaries.json) separately records each
package, binary, build environment key and installed path.

### Source, executable and release identities

Cargo package/directory/import names describe source responsibilities. Executable
packages use the same name for their binary and runner build flag; their build
environment variables use the uppercase underscore form. For example,
`cargo build -p runner-rpc-client` produces `runner-rpc-client`, installed at
`/usr/local/bin/runner-rpc-client`, with build flag `--runner-rpc-client` and
build environment key `RUNNER_RPC_CLIENT_PATH`.

The inventory records all installation directories and build environment keys.
Privileged helpers keep their `/sbin` placement; other helpers stay under
`/usr/local/bin`. API-owned mock selection settings such as
`OKOU_MOCK_CLAUDE_PATH` remain separate from these build-time identities.

Release configuration and workflow output keys use the new directory paths.
Renamed crates use their new
Cargo names as default release components and future tag prefixes, without
old-name component overrides. Manifest path keys move with unchanged numeric
versions; Release Please continues from those versions when new-name tags do not
yet exist. Historical tags and changelog entries are unchanged. The first release
under a new name may have a comparison link to a nonexistent new-name prior tag.
Existing unrelated component overrides (such as runner-rs and api-contracts-rs)
remain unchanged.

Component-specific log tags, operation labels and test fixtures use the current
component names. Guest-control worker threads use `gctl-` plus their task, with
names limited to 15 bytes for Linux thread-name visibility. Rust tracing targets
use their underscore form.
External log/metric queries and local tracing filters must use the new identifiers.
No old-name aliases or duplicate telemetry are emitted.

Runner and its bundled guest helpers are built together. Local rootfs hashes
include binary installation destinations and contents, and snapshot hashes include
the rootfs hash. Binary cache digests include the source tree and guest inventory.
Changing executable identities therefore creates distinct artifacts; existing
instances drain on their existing artifacts while new builds use the new paths.
Shared templates do not contain the injected helpers. Build scripts and explicit
binary overrides must use flags and environment keys matching the runner revision.

## Runner Operations

- [Host configuration and I/O capacity](../docs/runner-host-configuration.md):
  configure host-local concurrency and aggregate I/O capacity overrides.
- [Multi-architecture rollout](../docs/runner-multi-architecture.md): select,
  build, deploy, and validate architecture-specific runner artifacts.

### Local active input

`runner local input` requires a claimed local job with active-input forwarding
enabled. Ordinary submissions leave forwarding disabled. Enable it when submitting
the job with `runner local submit --active-input after=1s,text=hello` and the other
required submission arguments. An already-running job cannot enable forwarding
retroactively; resubmit it with the option when input is needed.

The input command rejects disabled forwarding or unavailable job metadata without
creating an input entry. A successful command reports file publication, not an
acknowledgement that the running agent consumed the input.

### Orphan sandbox termination

`runner kill --sandbox <ID>` first asks the owning runner to terminate the
sandbox. If that owner is gone, orphan termination validates the Firecracker
process and workspace through a retained `/proc/<pid>` directory handle and
signals the entire process group through that same kernel identity. A reused
numeric PID or PGID cannot redirect the signal to a different process group.

This orphan path requires Linux 6.9+ support for `pidfd_send_signal` with
`PIDFD_SIGNAL_PROCESS_GROUP`, and the verified target must be the group leader.
If the kernel or security policy rejects that operation, termination fails
without falling back to numeric signaling or deleting the sandbox's resources.
Inspect the reported error and host support before retrying. Normal termination
through an owning runner still uses its owned child lifecycle and does not gain
this new kernel requirement. `--run` targets do not fall back to orphan killing.

## nbd-cow Benchmark

The `nbd-cow` benchmark compares NBD COW with dm-snapshot using fio workloads. It is an opt-in,
feature-gated benchmark that must run as root on a host with the required device tooling.

Run it from the repository root:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p nbd-cow --features bench --bin bench -- [base-size-mb]
```

`base-size-mb` is optional. It specifies the base image size in MB, defaults to 1024 MB, and must
be at least 1024 MB (inclusive).

Before running the benchmark, ensure that:

- the process runs as root;
- `fio`, `losetup`, and `dmsetup` are available on `PATH`; and
- the NBD kernel module is loaded:

  ```bash
  modprobe nbd nbds_max=4096
  ```

## Logging

Runner Rust logs are recorded to local files, stderr, and CI at `info` and
above by default. Axiom ingests `warn` and above. Use `debug` or `trace` only
for local diagnostics that are acceptable to miss in production logs.

## TLS in Guest Binaries

Guest crates (`guest-agent`, `guest-storage-apply`) **must** use system certificate roots, not bundled webpki roots. The host runs a mitmproxy transparent proxy that intercepts HTTPS traffic with its own CA certificate, which is installed into the guest's system certificate store at boot. Using bundled roots would bypass the proxy CA and cause TLS verification failures.

Both HTTP clients in the workspace use `rustls-platform-verifier` to read from the system certificate store:

- **`reqwest`** (async) — used by `guest-agent`, `runner`, `ably-subscriber` with the `rustls` feature (aws-lc-rs crypto provider auto-installed).
- **`ureq`** (sync, no tokio) — used by `guest-storage-apply` with the `platform-verifier` feature. Uses `ring` by default.

## Building

```bash
# Native build
cargo build
cargo build --release

# Cross-compile with the faster CI/dev profile.
# Supported targets:
#   aarch64-unknown-linux-musl
#   x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
TARGET_TRIPLE=aarch64-unknown-linux-musl

# Step 1: build guest binaries
cargo build --target "$TARGET_TRIPLE" \
  -p guest-agent -p guest-storage-apply -p guest-init -p claude-mock -p codex-mock -p guest-state-restore -p guest-tool-exec -p guest-write-file -p guest-workspace-mount -p runner-rpc-client \
  --profile ci

# Step 2: build runner with embedded guests

cargo build --target "$TARGET_TRIPLE" -p runner --profile ci
```

## Testing

Use the `local` profile for routine local validation. Omit it when full debug information or
incremental compilation is more useful.

```bash
cargo test --profile local
cargo clippy --profile local --all-targets
```
