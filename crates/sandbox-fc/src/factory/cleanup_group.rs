//! Factory-owned asynchronous cleanup.
//!
//! `FactoryCleanupGroup` owns destroy and create-rollback cleanup after it is
//! registered, independently of the caller waiting for that cleanup. A tracked
//! cleanup future is spawned once and its task handle stays under group or
//! shutdown-batch ownership until completion, so dropping or cancelling the
//! returned waiter does not cancel the cleanup.
//!
//! The group has three lifecycle conditions:
//!
//! - **Accepting:** a new group starts here. Registrations are spawned and
//!   tracked normally.
//! - **Shutting down:** `shutdown` marks the lifecycle as shutting down while it
//!   drains tracked tasks. Registrations made while this condition remains are
//!   still spawned and tracked for the in-progress shutdown.
//! - **Closed:** shutdown has exhausted tracked work. Later registrations are
//!   not spawned; their cleanup future remains in the returned registration and
//!   runs in the caller only when that registration is awaited. Calling
//!   `start_accepting` after shutdown reopens the group.
//!
//! Shutdown has one 30-second production cleanup window shared across its
//! initial and late-registration batches. If the shutdown future is cancelled,
//! dropping its current batch puts unfinished task handles back into the group
//! so a later shutdown can resume ownership. If the window expires, shutdown
//! aborts unfinished tasks, briefly observes their cooperative cancellation,
//! and detaches any task that still cannot finish. Tasks registered during that
//! abort path are also aborted and passed through the bounded post-abort drain
//! before the group closes. Factory shutdown then continues to leak cleanup and
//! pool teardown; runner GC remains the final backstop for host resources left
//! by detached cleanup.
//!
//! The caller chooses how a caught cleanup panic affects its own operation.
//! `FirecrackerFactory::destroy` waits with panic propagation, while
//! `rollback_create_transaction` waits with logging and suppression so the
//! original create error remains authoritative. Dropping the group itself is an
//! abnormal best-effort fallback that cannot await cleanup and does not replace
//! an orderly `shutdown`.
