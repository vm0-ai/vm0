//! Bounded producer for connected, one-shot COW slots used by Firecracker VMs.
//!
//! Pre-creating the COW file and its NBD device removes that work from the
//! sandbox creation path. Every [`CowPoolHandle`] clone communicates with one
//! background actor, which exclusively owns [`state::CowPool`] and serializes
//! its state transitions.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! The actor distinguishes these ownership states:
//!
//! - the ready queue owns completed [`PreparedCowSlot`] values available for
//!   acquisition;
//! - pending tasks own in-flight slot creations;
//! - teardown tasks own completed slots that no longer belong in the ready
//!   pipeline;
//! - the waiter queue owns FIFO acquisition requests, not slots.
//!
//! A successful response transfers its slot out of producer ownership and
//! accounting. The caller consumes it through [`PreparedCowSlot::checkout_to`];
//! the slot is never returned to this producer. A receiver that closes before
//! the transfer is skipped without losing the slot.
//!
//! # Scheduling and bounds
//!
//! Pipeline inventory is the ready queue plus pending creations. Its target is
//! the warm buffer plus live acquisition waiters, capped by the global slot
//! limit. Creation and steady-state teardown tasks share bounded task capacity.
//! Ready slots and waiters are matched FIFO.
//!
//! A scheduled warm retry delays background-only replenishment, but live demand
//! may still start creation. One creation failure is delivered to one live
//! waiter; any remaining demand is repumped subject to the normal bounds. A
//! completed slot that is no longer needed enters explicit teardown instead of
//! increasing ready inventory.
//!
//! # Shutdown
//!
//! The actor's biased polling order considers cleanup, creation completions,
//! teardown completions, and due warm retries before ordinary queued commands
//! when multiple branches are ready. Cleanup deactivates the producer, rejects
//! acquisition waiters, completes warmup waiters, and drains ready slots,
//! in-flight creations, and existing teardowns. Successful late creations
//! remain pool-owned and enter the cleanup teardown queue.
//!
//! Cleanup acknowledges shutdown only after pending creations have drained and
//! all ready, late, and already-running [`destroy_prepared_slot_async`] teardown
//! work has finished. Finalization can preserve backing files when the NBD
//! device lifecycle cannot prove that deletion is safe.
