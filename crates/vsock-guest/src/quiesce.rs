//! Guest-operation admission and quiesce state for one host connection.
//!
//! An [`OperationState`] starts open. Each successful
//! [`OperationState::acquire`] admits one logical operation and increments its
//! pending count. [`OperationState::enter_quiescing`] atomically closes
//! admission before inspecting that count, so both [`QuiesceResult::Quiesced`]
//! and [`QuiesceResult::Busy`] leave new operations fenced.
//!
//! Entering quiescing does not wait for pending operations, register a waiter,
//! or send a later notification. A busy result is a point-in-time count; the
//! existing operations finish independently. Once they finish, the host must
//! retry the quiesce request to receive a quiesced acknowledgement. If the
//! attempt is abandoned instead, [`OperationState::resume`] explicitly reopens
//! admission, including while previously admitted operations remain pending.
//!
//! One acquire creates one shared [`OperationGuard`]. Cloning the guard shares
//! ownership of that logical operation and does not increment the pending
//! count. The count is released by [`OperationGuard::release`] or, if it is not
//! released explicitly, when the final guard clone drops.
