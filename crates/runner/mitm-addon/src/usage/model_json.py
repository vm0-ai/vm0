        usage: Protocol-specific normalized usage data, or ``None`` when usage inspection is
            disabled, no usage is present, or usage extraction did not complete. When usage
            extraction does not complete, ``usage_error`` contains the parser diagnostic.
        usage_error: The usage parser diagnostic when extraction did not complete. This is
            ``None`` when usage inspection is disabled, no usage is present in complete JSON, or
            usage was extracted successfully.
        failure: Bounded :class:`ModelHttpFailureEvidence` for the same JSON document. When
            failure inspection is disabled, this is the default, intentionally invalid evidence.
            When it is enabled, callers must check ``failure.is_valid`` before interpreting the
            projection as provider outcome evidence. Failure-sensitive overflow can invalidate
            this projection while leaving ``usage`` available when both consumers are enabled.
