"""Per-connector billing and response parser dispatch.

One file per billable connector under this package owns the connector's
domain-specific request / response parsing.  :func:`report_connector_usage`
is the single entry point called by the addon response / error handlers;
it applies the universal gates (``run_id`` present, firewall flagged
billable by the web layer, firewall has a registered handler) and
delegates to the matching per-connector ``report_usage`` function.

Billable connector metadata comes from the accepted connector catalog and
reaches the runner through the claim's ``billableFirewalls`` list. Adding a new
billable connector means marking its catalog firewall billable, adding a
connector module here, and registering its reporter plus optional
response-inspection capability in :data:`_REGISTRATIONS`.
Response inspection owns both parser creation and buffered-fallback selection,
so those decisions cannot drift across independent registries.
