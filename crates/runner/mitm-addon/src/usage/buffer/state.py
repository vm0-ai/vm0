"""Lock-protected mutable state for the usage buffer.

State ownership
---------------
Callers hold ``UsageEventBuffer._lock`` for every state transition. Accepted
source records are represented by exactly one of these work domains:

* *Live* work is still mutable in the aggregate and source-preserving event and
  observation stores. ``snapshot_live_flush()`` atomically replaces those
  stores with empty ones and transfers their contents to one pending flush.
* *Pending* work is a batch snapshot eligible for selection, or a retained
  snapshot waiting for a later retry. Selecting a pending flush and calling
  ``begin_delivery()`` transfers its ownership to the delivering domain.
* *Delivering* work has entered webhook admission and remains here until every
  admitted callback is resolved. Successful or permanent outcomes leave the
  state; retryable or unadmitted batches return to pending ownership unless the
  retry budget drops them.

``_seen_source_keys`` is admission history, not a work domain. Accepted source
and atomic admission keys survive flush boundaries in this process. The history
is bounded by insertion order: duplicate checks do not refresh an entry,
overflow evicts the earliest inserted keys, and ``clear()`` resets the history
along with all work domains.

Admission and callback ordering
-------------------------------
``begin_delivery()`` counts the entire pending flush before admission starts
because a delivery callback may complete synchronously inside the enqueue call.
Each callback decrements ``remaining_batch_count`` and records a retryable
outcome when applicable. Admission completion then reconciles that callback
state with the admitted prefix:

* When admitted callbacks remain unresolved, the admitted prefix stays in the
  delivering domain, ``remaining_batch_count`` becomes the number of unresolved
  admitted callbacks, and the unadmitted suffix is retained as pending work.
* When no admitted callback remains, including when no batch was admitted, the
  retryable admitted batches and unadmitted suffix are retained together and
  delivering ownership ends.

Callbacks that finish the delivering flush first remove its ownership, so later
admission reconciliation cannot retain a second copy. Retryable callbacks are
rebuilt in original batch order rather than callback-completion order.

Retry eligibility and ordering
------------------------------
A retained flush records the current flush generation and is ineligible for the
rest of that flush invocation; a later invocation has a new generation and may
select it. Billable ``usage_event`` batches have priority over observation
batches. When live work is eligible for a snapshot, it preempts available
pending work only at a strictly higher priority; list order is FIFO among
equal-priority pending flushes. Original flush batch indices preserve same-flush
order when callbacks finish out of order or retain additional fragments later.

Each retention increments the batch's retained retry count. A batch already at
the configured maximum is dropped instead of returning to pending ownership.
Delivering work is not schedulable, and ``_active_enqueue_count`` blocks another
selection only while admission is active; after admission returns, newer live
work may be flushed while older delivery callbacks are still outstanding.

Observable count and verification
---------------------------------
``buffered_source_event_count()`` sums original source records represented by
live stores, retained pending flushes, and delivering flushes. Aggregated
batches therefore contribute their source-record count, not their payload-event
count. Admission history and active-enqueue bookkeeping are excluded.

The integration contracts for these invariants live in
``tests/test_usage_buffer_flush_failures.py``,
``tests/test_usage_buffer_timer_shutdown.py``, and
``tests/test_usage_buffer_idempotency.py``.
