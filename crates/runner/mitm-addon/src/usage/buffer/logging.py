"""Proxy-log helpers for usage buffer flushes.

Most flush summaries are ordinary ``usage_event_buffer_flush`` records, but
retained or dropped batches can be billing-impacting underbilling signals:

- ``started`` marks enqueue/admission start.
- ``enqueued`` marks enqueue/admission completion and may include retained
  counters for batches kept for retry.
- ``failed`` marks an enqueue exception and logs at error level.
- ``retained`` marks asynchronous delivery outcomes kept for retry.
- ``dropped`` marks retained batches whose retry budget was exhausted.

Dropped retained batches always emit ``usage_underbilling`` with
``reason=retry_budget_exhausted`` and ``underbilling_class=confirmed``.
Shutdown-retained batches emit ``usage_underbilling`` with
``reason=shutdown_retained_without_retry`` and ``underbilling_class=risk``.

Operators should use ``retained_source_event_count`` and
``retained_webhook_batch_count`` for retained work, and
``dropped_source_event_count`` and ``dropped_webhook_batch_count`` for confirmed
drops. Dropped retained batches also include ``retained_retry_count``. When no
proxy log path exists, ordinary flush records are skipped; underbilling records
use the stderr fallback in ``log_usage_underbilling``.
