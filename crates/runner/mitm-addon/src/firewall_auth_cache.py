"""Firewall auth cache, fetch admission, and force-refresh lifecycle.

The cache separates credential identity from registry ownership freshness. A cache key is
credential-equivalent when its ``(run_id, api_id, auth_identity)`` fields match. Its optional
``registry_generation`` records which published registry snapshot authorized the lookup, but is
not part of credential identity, so an unchanged auth identity can reuse its cached payload and
refresh lifecycle across registry snapshots.

Shared ownership is limited to one auth identity per ``(run_id, api_id)`` scope. A current registry
generation may claim that scope or replace its previous identity. A stale generation can use
existing equivalent state, but cannot create, replace, or reclaim shared ownership; when no
equivalent state remains, its fetch uses detached state instead. Registry reconciliation also
removes ownership for runs that are no longer active.

    No-op if a force-refresh marker was consumed within
    ``_FORCE_REFRESH_COOLDOWN_SECS``. The cooldown starts when the marker is
    consumed, before the forced fetch completes, so the same window covers
    requests made while that fetch is in flight or after it fails. This

    Design notes for future changes:

    * The consume timestamp in ``state.last_force_refresh_monotonic_at`` is
      written **before** ``fetch_firewall_headers`` is awaited in
      ``get_firewall_headers``, not after. Recording after would allow a 401
      arriving during the fetch to re-add the marker; after the fetch
      completes and writes the cache, a later cache miss would then consume
      the stale marker and trigger an unnecessary second refresh. The
      trade-off is that a failed fetch (webhook down,
      ``TOKEN_REFRESH_FAILED``, etc.) still burns the cooldown — intentional,
      because if the refresh grant itself is broken, retrying faster than once
      per cooldown wouldn't help and would hammer the provider.
    * The cooldown is process-local elapsed time and uses ``time.monotonic()``.
      Absolute webhook ``expiresAt`` checks remain wall-clock based elsewhere
      in this module.
