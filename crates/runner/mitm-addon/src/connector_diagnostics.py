"""Connector diagnostic hook lifecycle for mitmproxy HTTP flows.

``mitm_addon`` owns hook orchestration, while this module owns connector-intent
handling, flow-scoped diagnostic lookup state, response replacement, diagnostic
proxy logging, and diagnostic stream cleanup. Catalog compilation and matching
remain in ``builtin_connector_diagnostics``.

Lifecycle:

- ``requestheaders()`` and ``request()`` both capture connector intent before
  classification and strip the private header before forwarding. A provisional
  header-phase classification may restore the exported probe metadata when it
  falls through to the request hook.
- The header hook may probe an unknown-endpoint firewall allow with
  ``commit=False``. A miss does not persist a newly selected snapshot, while a
  successful local diagnostic pins the snapshot it used. Carried-forward
  ordinary allow flows call ``record_allow_context()`` before request streaming.
- The request hook uses ``commit=True`` for the committed unknown-endpoint path
  and calls ``record_allow_context()`` for ordinary allows. These paths pin one
  diagnostic catalog snapshot so later response and error handling cannot
  switch catalog generations during the same flow.
- ``responseheaders()`` offers eligible 401/403 responses to
  ``install_response_stream_if_needed()`` before installing general response
  streaming. A diagnostic stream suppresses the upstream body and emits its
  replacement body once.
- ``response()`` completes streamed replacement or handles buffered 401/403
  replacement before network logging. ``error()`` may synthesize a diagnostic
  response unless response headers already installed a replacement.
- Terminal response, error, and WebSocket cleanup call ``release_flow_state()``
  from exception-safe cleanup to release diagnostic-private state and detach an
  installed diagnostic stream callback.

Connector-intent capture and request-header probe metadata live in
``connector_intent``. Terminal release here instead owns diagnostic-private
snapshot, lookup, candidate, ownership, stream, and log guard state. Public
diagnostic/firewall metadata used for observable logging and generic response-
stream state have separate owners.
