"""Shared ``flow.metadata`` keys used across mitm addon modules.

This module is the public cross-module registry for metadata keys that flow
between mitmproxy hooks and addon packages. Hook-local private markers may
exist in their owning modules, but they are not part of this shared contract.
When adding a shared metadata key, add its ownership and lifecycle notes here.

Request context
---------------
- ``VM_RUN_ID``: ``str`` copied from registry VM info by HTTP request
  classification and ``tcp_start()``. Header-phase HTTP probes restore this key
  unless they intentionally keep the classification for a streaming or local
  response path. Read by HTTP, TCP, proxy logging, and usage reporting.
- ``VM_NETWORK_LOG_PATH``: ``str`` copied from registry VM info. Read by HTTP
  and TCP log writers; empty strings skip network-log writes.
- ``VM_PROXY_LOG_PATH``: ``str`` copied from registry VM info. Read by proxy
  warnings, usage reporting, and auth/streaming diagnostics.
- ``VM_SANDBOX_AUTH_KEY``: ``str`` sandbox token copied from registry VM info.
  Read by usage webhook reporters.
- ``ORIGINAL_URL``: absolute URL written by HTTP request classification from
  trusted authority, or from the authority-validation fallback URL on local
  denial. Asterisk-form contributes an empty URL path while its raw ``*``
  target remains on the request and firewall decision. Read by response/error
  logging and connector billing.
- ``NETWORK_LOG_TARGET``: ``dict`` with ``url``, ``host``, and ``port`` from
  trusted authority or authority-validation fallback URL. Read by network-log
  entry construction.
- ``CAPTURE_BODY``: ``bool`` copied from registry VM info by HTTP request
  classification. Read by ``response()`` to decide whether to add
  request/response bodies.
- ``SUPPRESS_REQUEST_BODY_CAPTURE``: ``bool`` written by auth.base request-size
  handling. Read by body capture to mark oversized request bodies truncated.
- ``CLI_AGENT_TYPE``: ``str`` copied from registry VM info, defaulting to
  ``"claude-code"``. Read by model-provider usage protocol selection.
- ``BROWSER_USER_AGENT``: ``bool`` written during request classification when
  the request matches the short-term browser passthrough User-Agent heuristic.
  Read by request dispatch to skip connector firewall handling and managed
  credential mutation, and by network-log entry construction.
- ``WEBSOCKET_UPGRADE_REQUEST``: ``bool`` written by request handling when the
  HTTP/1.1 request is a confirmed WebSocket upgrade handshake. Read by
  response streaming so only matching 101 responses defer model-provider usage
  release until ``websocket_end()``.

Timing context
--------------
- ``HTTP_REQUEST_START_MONOTONIC``: ``float`` from ``time.monotonic()``,
  written when a request first reaches a registered-VM HTTP path, including
  header-phase streaming and local auth.base rejection paths. Popped by
  ``response()`` or ``error()`` when computing HTTP latency, and removed on
  request failures.
- ``TCP_START_MONOTONIC``: ``float`` from ``time.monotonic()``, written by
  ``tcp_start()``. Read by TCP end/error logging; it is not popped.

Firewall and auth context
-------------------------
- ``FIREWALL_BASE``: ``str`` matched firewall base. Written by firewall match,
  matched firewall block, and auth paths. Read by logging, auth cache
  invalidation, usage dispatch, and local error responses.
- ``FIREWALL_API_ID``: ``str`` API id or base fallback from the matched
  firewall. Read by auth handling.
- ``FIREWALL_AUTH_CACHE_KEY``: opaque typed auth cache key written by matched
  auth handling after the full auth input identity is known. Read by 401 cache
  invalidation; stores only a digest of auth inputs and sandbox token.
- ``FIREWALL_AUTH_PROBE_FAILURE``: ``Exception`` caught by header-phase auth
  probing after restoring the probe snapshot. Popped by request-phase auth
  handling to produce the same local auth failure without resolving auth a
  second time; removed by terminal cleanup when it was not consumed.
- ``FIREWALL_NAME``: ``str`` firewall connector/model name. Read by logging,
  model-provider gates, and connector usage dispatch.
- ``FIREWALL_PERMISSION``: ``str`` matched permission name or empty string.
  Read by logging and connector-specific billing.
- ``FIREWALL_RULE_MATCH``: ``str`` matched rule or empty string. Read by
  network-log firewall metadata.
- ``FIREWALL_PARAMS``: ``dict`` firewall params from the match. Read by
  network-log firewall metadata when it has the expected shape.
- ``FIREWALL_BILLABLE``: ``bool`` computed from runner VM billable firewall
  context for matched auth flows, or forced ``False`` for browser passthrough
  and policy-only asterisk-form allows. Gates connector billing, model-provider
  billing, and connector response parser setup; model usage observation still
  checks model-provider-specific gates.
- ``FIREWALL_ACTION``: ``str`` firewall decision such as ``ALLOW``, ``DENY``,
  or ``BLOCK``. Read by response/error network logging.
- ``FIREWALL_ERROR``: optional ``str`` error code for auth, forwarding, or
  registry failures. It is orthogonal to ``FIREWALL_ACTION``: an ``ALLOW``
  decision can still have an auth or forwarding error.
- ``CONNECTOR_DIAGNOSTIC_TYPE``: optional ``str`` connector type for a generic
  connector availability diagnostic. HTTP request classification records this
  for an inactive built-in connector candidate from the request-header stream
  path or the request hook; network logs expose it only after the response/error
  hook turns the candidate into an agent-visible diagnostic.
- ``CONNECTOR_DIAGNOSTIC_REASON``: optional ``str`` generic diagnostic reason.
  First-version diagnostics use ``not_configured_for_run``.
- ``CONNECTOR_DIAGNOSTIC_ENV_NAMES``: optional ``list[str]`` env aliases that
  would normally expose connector credentials. Names only; never values.
- ``CONNECTOR_DIAGNOSTIC_BASE``: optional ``str`` matched static built-in base
  URL that produced the diagnostic.
- ``CONNECTOR_ROUTE_REASON``: optional ``str`` connector-route ambiguity reason.
- ``CONNECTOR_ROUTE_CANDIDATES``: optional ``list[str]`` of config-derived
  connector owners for an ambiguous route. Never contains the supplied hint.
- ``AUTH_RESOLVED_SECRETS``: ``list[str]`` from successful auth resolution.
  Read by network-log firewall metadata.
- ``AUTH_REFRESHED_CONNECTORS``: ``list[str]`` from successful auth resolution.
  Read by network-log firewall metadata.
- ``AUTH_REFRESHED_SECRETS``: ``list[str]`` from successful auth resolution.
  Read by network-log firewall metadata.
- ``AUTH_CACHE_HIT``: ``bool`` from successful auth resolution. Read by
  network-log firewall metadata.
- ``AUTH_URL_REWRITE``: ``bool`` written only after inline auth.base forwarding
  succeeds and sets the provider response on the flow. Read by network-log
  firewall metadata.
- ``AUTH_BASE_FORWARD_ADMISSION``: opaque auth.base forwarding admission
  reservation written by header-phase auth.base admission and consumed by the
  request auth.base forwarder path. Released by request/terminal cleanup if it
  is not transferred to the forwarder.
- ``AWS_SIGV4_BODY_ADMISSION``: opaque aggregate reservation for a buffered
  body-dependent SigV4 request. Written before body buffering and released by
  terminal flow cleanup.
- ``TRUSTED_AUTHORITY_HOST``: ``str`` host from authority validation. Read by
  auth-base URL rewrite logic when reconstructing trusted request authority.

Response streaming
------------------
- ``RESPONSE_STREAM_STATE``: ``dict`` containing ``total_bytes`` for the
  general response stream callback. Read for exact response-size logging and
  removed by stream cleanup.
- ``STREAM_BUFFER``: capped ``bytearray`` written by ``responseheaders()`` via
  response streaming setup only when body capture or usage fallback needs raw
  response bytes. Read by body capture, model JSON fallback extraction, and
  connector fallback parsing. Removed by stream cleanup after terminal hooks.
- ``STREAM_BUFFER_STATE``: ``dict`` containing ``truncated``. Written only
  with ``STREAM_BUFFER`` and read for capture truncation and connector fallback
  parsing. Removed by stream cleanup.

Request streaming
-----------------
- ``REQUEST_STREAM_BUFFER``: capped ``bytearray`` written by
  ``requestheaders()`` via request streaming setup for stream-safe body
  capture paths. Read by request body capture and connector billing refinement.
  Removed by stream cleanup after terminal hooks.
- ``REQUEST_STREAM_BUFFER_STATE``: ``dict`` with at least ``truncated`` and
  ``total_bytes``. Always written by request streaming setup and read for
  request size. Capture-enabled paths also write ``REQUEST_STREAM_BUFFER`` and
  use this state for capture truncation and connector billing refinement.
  Removed by stream cleanup.
- ``REQUEST_STREAM_COMPLETE``: ``bool`` written by ``request()`` after
  mitmproxy has delivered the full streamed request body to the addon. Read by
  connector billing before treating a non-truncated request stream buffer as a
  complete request body. Removed by stream cleanup.

Model-provider usage
--------------------
- ``MODEL_PROVIDER_USAGE``: ``dict`` of normalized token usage for one
  flow-level model response source. Written by streaming/JSON extractors,
  WebSocket missing-response-id fallback extraction, or fallback extraction,
  then read by model usage-event and observation reporters.
- ``MODEL_PROVIDER_USAGE_SOURCES``: ``dict`` keyed by WebSocket response id,
  with normalized token usage dict values. Written by WebSocket model-provider
  usage extraction and read by model usage-event and observation reporters.
  Entries are released before ``websocket_end()`` after each source-preserving
  report attempt. Zero-only entries are also released immediately because
  observable model-provider flows already carry ``MODEL_USAGE_PROVIDER``.
- ``MODEL_USAGE_PROVIDER``: optional ``str`` canonical model id from registry VM
  info. Read by model-provider usage observability and reported-model selection.
- ``MODEL_USAGE_PRICING``: optional signed model-provider pricing metadata with
  the unit size and credits-per-token-category map. Read only by billable
  usage-event reporting.
- ``MODEL_JSON_USAGE_FINALIZED``: ``bool`` written when JSON usage finalization
  ran. Read by ``response()`` to skip legacy fallback JSON extraction.

Connector usage and parser state
--------------------------------
- ``X_NDJSON_STATE``: ``dict`` owned by the X connector NDJSON parser. Written
  when a streaming X response parser is registered and read by X billing.
- ``X_JSON_STATE``: ``dict`` owned by the X connector JSON parser. Written by
  connector parser finalization before normal response billing, then read by X
  billing instead of the capped stream-buffer fallback.
