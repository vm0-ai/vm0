//! R2 cache for `runner build` template artifacts.
//!
//! The current shared cache stores reusable template objects at
//! `runner-templates/{template_hash}.tar.zst` in the existing
//! `R2_USER_STORAGES_BUCKET_NAME` bucket. Rootfs images are customized locally
//! because they contain guest binaries and host-local CA material.
//! Snapshot files are always created locally because they contain host-specific
//! state (page cache, kernel metadata).
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. `runner build` computes a `template_hash` for the shared R2 object and
//!    a separate `rootfs_hash` for local images.
//! 2. `--warm-rootfs-cache` ensures the template R2 object exists. Existing
//!    objects are checked with HEAD only; normal builds still validate the
//!    archive before using it.
//! 3. Normal builds materialize the template object into a per-attempt local
//!    file (or build/upload it on miss), move the verified template into
//!    `rootfs.ext4.staging`, customize the staging image locally, verify it,
//!    and then atomically commit the rootfs.
//!
//! Atomicity guarantees:
//! - Multipart upload is atomic from consumer POV (object only appears after
//!   `CompleteMultipartUpload`); abandoned segments are auto-cleaned by R2's
//!   default 7-day lifecycle.
//! - Template download unpacks into a sibling staging directory and only renames
//!   `template.ext4` into the caller's destination after the archive is fully
//!   decoded and validated.
//!
//! Configuration semantics: `from_env` returns `Ok(None)` only when **all four**
//! `R2_*` env vars are unset or empty (dev/test path). Setting 1-3 of 4 is a
//! fatal `PartialConfig` error — almost certainly a typo'd secret rotation, and
//! silently disabling cache fleet-wide is worse than failing the deploy.
//!
//! Streaming: upload avoids temp files by using a `tokio::io::duplex` pipe to
//! couple the sync tar+zstd producer (on a blocking thread) to the async
//! multipart consumer. Download streams the S3 body through `SyncIoBridge` into
//! a sibling staging directory, then renames the extracted `template.ext4` to
//! the caller's destination. Callers that coordinate shared output paths should
//! pass an attempt-scoped destination and perform their own final publish step.
//! Memory peak per upload ≈ `(2 + CONCURRENCY + 1) × PART_SIZE` — duplex buffer,
//! in-flight upload chunks, and the part being read — bounded regardless of
//! image size. Currently ~112 MiB with `PART_SIZE` = 16 MiB and `CONCURRENCY` = 4.
//!
//! Image size limit: `PART_SIZE * 10000 ≈ 160 GiB` (S3 multipart hard limit).
//! Current images are well under 30 GiB; revisit if `PART_SIZE` decreases.
//!
//! ## R2-side cleanup
//!
//! Completed objects are **never deleted on upload**. Each template cache version
//! bump or template build script change produces a new template hash and
//! orphans the previous object.
//!
//! Cleanup happens via `gc_older_than`, called from `runner gc` (which the
//! deploy playbook runs after every release). Default TTL is 7 days. Each
//! host runs the same scan independently — `DeleteObjects` is idempotent for
//! already-absent keys, so concurrent fleet execution is safe and costs
//! ~1 LIST + 1 batched DELETE per host per gc cycle.
//!
//! R2's default 7-day lifecycle rule only cleans abandoned multipart
//! segments, **not** completed objects — which is why we need our own scan.
//!
//! **Clock skew caveat**: `gc_older_than` uses local `SystemTime::now()` to
//! compute the cutoff. If the host clock drifts ahead of R2 server time by
//! more than the TTL, GC over-deletes (worst case: wipes everything older
//! than `now_local - keep_days`, even objects that were just uploaded by
//! peers with correct clocks). Mitigation: keep NTP healthy. A clock behind
//! R2 is the safe direction (under-deletes, no data loss).
//!
//! ## Cancellation safety
//!
//! All operations in this module are safe to cancel (drop the future) at any
//! await point — no permanent state is left in an inconsistent way:
//!
//! - **Local staging directory**: a hard-killed template download may leave a
//!   `*.download.tmp/` directory beside the destination. The next download
//!   removes it as the first action, so the leak is bounded to one stale dir
//!   per destination and self-heals on next attempt.
//! - **R2 multipart upload session**: once `create_multipart_upload` returns,
//!   an owned guard aborts the upload on normal errors and schedules a
//!   best-effort abort if the upload future is cancelled before disarm.
//! - **`spawn_blocking` pack / unpack tasks**: tokio cannot cancel
//!   blocking tasks. After parent cancellation, the producer/consumer
//!   thread runs until it hits BrokenPipe or natural EOF — wasted CPU for
//!   a few seconds, no resource leak.
//!
//! ## Corrupt-object eviction
//!
//! A structurally-valid archive whose extracted content lacks template.ext4
//! (e.g. uploaded by an old/buggy producer, or attacker-controlled IAM
//! key writing a bogus tar to a predicted hash key) would otherwise
//! dead-lock the fleet's cache for that hash: every host downloads → unpacks
//! → finds no template → rebuilds locally → dedup-skips upload because the bad
//! object already exists.
//!
//! `cmd::build::run_build` defends by passing `force = true` to upload
//! whenever template download classifies an object as invalid. That bypasses the
//! dedup check and atomically overwrites the bad object via multipart complete.
//!
//! ## Tar entry security
//!
//! The `tar` crate (0.4) has two relevant behaviors when consuming an
//! attacker-influenced archive:
//!
//! 1. **Path traversal (`..` components) is silently dropped**. Verified by
//!    `unpack_rejects_path_traversal`. The malicious entry is skipped; the
//!    staging dir ends up missing template.ext4; the template download helper
//!    rejects that as an invalid object and the caller rebuilds locally. Safe.
//!
//! 2. **Symlink and hardlink entries are rejected**. `unpack_from_reader`
//!    iterates entries and rejects any whose type is not `Regular`,
//!    `Continuous`, or `GNUSparse` — symlinks, hardlinks, character/block
//!    devices, FIFOs, and extended-header pseudo-entries all cause an
//!    immediate error, preventing an attacker with R2 write access from
//!    crafting a tar where expected filenames are symlinks to host paths.
//!    (`GNUSparse` is retained for forward compatibility with any future
//!    sparse file in the archive; template.ext4 itself is packed as a
//!    regular file.)
//!
//! **Maintenance note**: `try_download_template_file_by_key` verifies that the
//! archive contains a regular `template.ext4` file and classifies a missing or
//! non-file member as an invalid object. If you add a new required member to the
//! template R2 archive, extend that validation accordingly — otherwise an
//! attacker-controlled tar that omits the new file would go undetected.
