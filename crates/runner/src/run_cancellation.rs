//! Per-run cancellation state shared by provider, lifecycle, admission, and
//! execution paths.
//!
//! [`RunCancellationRegistry`] owns one [`RunCancellationHandle`] for each
//! registered run. The [`RunCancellationRegistration`] returned by
//! [`RunCancellationRegistry::register`] is the lifecycle owner for that
//! registry entry: it must stay owned until the run has been cleaned up, and
//! callers must explicitly call [`RunCancellationRegistration::unregister`].
//! Dropping the registration does not remove the entry.
//!
//! ## Cancellation protocol
//!
//! A registration is unique by run ID. A duplicate registration is rejected
//! so that provider and local cancellation continue to target the active
//! handle. [`RunCancellationRegistry::begin_hard_stop`] marks the hard-stop
//! barrier and returns a snapshot of registrations that existed at that
//! point. The caller dispatches hard cancellation to that snapshot. A
//! registration created after the barrier is inserted and then returned with
//! hard cancellation already requested.
//!
//! Each handle exposes an aggregate cancellation token and two independent
//! class-specific tokens through [`RunCancellationSignals`]. Either a
//! cooperative-user request or a hard request cancels the aggregate token;
//! only the matching class-specific token is cancelled. Request methods return
//! whether their cancellation class changed from not requested to requested.
//! The signals are monotonic, so a hard cancellation remains observable after
//! a cooperative request and a cooperative request does not imply hard
//! cancellation.
//!
//! ## Ownership transfer protocol
//!
//! The handle's transfer gate serializes cancellation requests with ownership
//! transitions for a sandbox. A caller transferring or publishing ownership
//! should acquire [`RunCancellationHandle::transfer_guard`], inspect the
//! applicable cancellation signal while holding it, perform the ownership
//! transition, and release the guard only after the transition is complete.
//! The gate is not itself a cancellation signal.
//!
//! A caller must not await the transfer gate while holding another shared lock
//! whose release is needed by cancellation or finalization. It should use
//! [`RunCancellationHandle::try_transfer_guard`] while holding that lock and,
//! when the attempt fails, release the other lock before awaiting the gate.
//! The idle-pool publication path in
//! [`sandbox_finalization`](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0/blob/main/crates/runner/src/cmd/start/sandbox_finalization.rs#L809-L829)
//! follows this ordering. The broader lifecycle is exercised by
//! [`signals`](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0/blob/main/crates/runner/src/cmd/start/signals.rs#L213-L247),
//! [`provider cancellation`](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0/blob/main/crates/runner/src/provider/api_ably_supervisor.rs#L850-L884),
//! [`job discovery`](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0/blob/main/crates/runner/src/cmd/start/job_discovery.rs#L976-L1004),
//! [`sandbox finalization`](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0/blob/main/crates/runner/src/cmd/start/sandbox_finalization.rs#L697-L732),
//! and the focused
//! [`cancellation tests`](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0/blob/main/crates/runner/src/run_cancellation.rs#L276-L349).
//! The job-discovery-specific ownership lifecycle is described in
//! [issue #30953](https://github.com/vm0-ai/vm0/issues/30953).
