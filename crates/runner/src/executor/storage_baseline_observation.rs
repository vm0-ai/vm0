//! Process-local shadow observations for likely storage-baseline candidates.
//!
//! The observer measures whether the exact set of entries marked as baseline candidates is stable
//! across consecutive jobs. It is an observational telemetry aid only: its result does not affect
//! storage selection, materialization, cache reuse, or any other execution decision.
//!
//! In production, the observer is owned by [`super::ExecutorConfig`], so its state is local to the
//! Runner process and resets when the Runner restarts. The previous candidate set is kept separately
//! for each configured profile and [`EffectiveCliFramework`]. Candidate identities remain in this
//! process-local state only; they are not emitted to telemetry, persisted, hashed, or transformed
//! into stable pseudonyms.
