//! Ownership-preserving transitions from an active sandbox to idle reuse.
//!
//! The transition has two ownership boundaries that must not be conflated:
//! [`IdleParkRequest`] owns an active sandbox until physical parking and
//! reuse-preparation validation complete, while a [`ParkedIdleCandidate`] owns
//! a sandbox that has physically parked but has not yet been accepted by
//! [`super::IdlePool`]. Only an accepted [`super::entry::IdleEntry`] is
//! pool-owned.
//!
//! The transition contract is:
//!
//! 1. **Active-owned.** The request owns the sandbox, factory, budget lease,
//!    metadata, and any unpublished workspace promotion. A promotion identity
//!    mismatch is abandoned before returning. A preparation-construction error
//!    or a returned park error returns the promotion to the active finalization
//!    cleanup path. A panic makes the park state uncertain, so the promotion is
//!    abandoned before active ownership is returned. If an active failure is
//!    instead converted into a speculative rollback destroy job, that path
//!    abandons the unpublished promotion because it is not active finalization.
//! 2. **Parked-owned.** Once the sandbox park operation succeeds, validation of
//!    the reuse-preparation result can still reject admission. That rejection
//!    is represented by [`IdleParkFailureParts::Parked`]; the finalization
//!    caller must destroy the rejected parked candidate and must not treat it as
//!    an active sandbox or insert it into the pool. Its destroy payload keeps
//!    [`super::entry::WorkspacePromotionPolicy::Promote`], so the parked
//!    cleanup lifecycle may unpark, prepare, and publish a valid promotion
//!    before destruction.
//! 3. **Idle-pool-owned.** A successful ordinary outcome becomes a pool entry
//!    only after the caller passes its [`ParkedIdleCandidate`] to
//!    [`super::IdlePool::park`]. A reusable candidate may be admitted; a
//!    non-reusable result remains caller-owned and is destroyed. An immediate
//!    handoff candidate must be delivered to the waiting exact successor or
//!    destroyed.
//! 4. **Exact handoff.** The finalization caller supplies the optional handoff
//!    only for the exact-history predecessor/successor path. The transition
//!    does not independently prove that caller-side relationship. A successful
//!    handoff changes the result from generic idle publication to a candidate
//!    bound to that waiting successor; an undelivered candidate remains owned
//!    by the caller for cleanup.
//! 5. **Speculative rollback.** A reserved exact-generation entry can be
//!    unparked for claim-time preparation without becoming committed to a job.
//!    [`SpeculativeIdleSandbox::repark_for_claim_rollback`] re-runs preparation
//!    against the entry's original history-generation runtime directory, not
//!    the rollback operation's diagnostic run directory. A successful repark
//!    restores the original `parked_at` and metadata. Every other result
//!    returns an [`IdleDestroyJob`] with the appropriate promotion policy.
//!
//! The finalization cleanup and speculative rollback callers consume
//! [`IdleParkFailureParts`] and [`SpeculativeReparkResult`], respectively. The
//! focused coverage for these ownership rules lives in
//! `park_transition_tests.rs`.
