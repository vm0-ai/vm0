//! Guest init process for Firecracker.
//!
//! Runs as PID 1 inside a Firecracker VM. PID 1 synchronously waits for blocked
//! child and shutdown signals, then reaps every available zombie.
//!
//! Like tini, guest-init forks a child process (PID 2) to run vsock-guest.
//! PID 1 then enters an event-driven supervision loop, waiting for the child to
//! exit while also reaping orphaned zombie processes.
//!
//! This architecture separates wait domains and supervision phases:
//! - PID 1 blocks `SIGCHLD`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGINT` before `fork()` and waits
//!   for them synchronously, eliminating polling and lost-wakeup windows.
//! - On `SIGCHLD`, PID 1 calls `waitpid(-1, WNOHANG)` until every available
//!   PID 2 or orphaned process has been reaped.
//! - After escalating shutdown to SIGKILL, PID 1 switches to blocking
//!   `waitpid(child_pid, 0)` to reap PID 2.
//! - PID 2 (vsock-guest) calls `waitpid(pid)` for the commands it spawns. While
//!   PID 2 owns those children, PID 1 cannot reap them, so the processes do not
//!   race and PID 2 does not see `ECHILD` from PID 1's reaper.
//! - PID 1's generic and targeted waits run sequentially in the same thread, so
//!   they cannot race with each other.
//!
//! Startup sequence:
//! 1. Initialize guest filesystems, environment, and cgroup v2 exec containment.
//!    Failure is fatal before `vsock-guest` is forked.
//! 2. Configure PID 1 signals and block supervised signals
//! 3. Fork child process
//! 4. Child (PID 2): restore its inherited signal mask, run vsock-guest
//! 5. Parent (PID 1): wait for child and shutdown events
