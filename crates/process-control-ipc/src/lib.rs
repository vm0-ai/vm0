#![deny(missing_docs)]

//! Local process-control IPC channel for a guest operation control sink.
//!
//! This crate defines the local, blocking protocol used after `vsock-guest`
//! exposes an operation-control endpoint and `guest-agent` connects back to it.
//! The control and companion placement channels use Linux abstract Unix stream
//! sockets, so endpoint names are not filesystem paths. Root-owned placement
//! descriptors move with `SCM_RIGHTS` and are never inherited through the
//! sandbox-user launch chain.
//!
//! The endpoint is bootstrapped through [`BOOTSTRAP_ENV`] or its reader-only
//! canonical alias [`CANONICAL_BOOTSTRAP_ENV`]. `vsock-guest` creates the
//! endpoint name with [`endpoint_name`], binds it with
//! [`bind_abstract_listener`], accepts a single control sink connection, and
//! then drives request/response exchange. `guest-agent` resolves the endpoint
//! name from the environment, connects with [`connect_abstract`], sends a hello
//! frame, then reads requests and writes responses.
//!
//! Two companion placement endpoints are derived from the same operation-local
//! control name. The one-shot runtime endpoint transfers a root-opened
//! `workload/runtime/cgroup.procs` descriptor to Guest Agent, which confirms
//! after validating and adopting it. The tool endpoint serves repeated
//! authenticated Bash-launcher connections: root creates a
//! unique tool cgroup, transfers its write-only `cgroup.procs` descriptor, and
//! acknowledges only after the launcher confirms and root revalidates exact
//! placement. User shell code does not run before that acknowledgement.
//!
//! ## Frame format
//!
//! Every frame uses this envelope:
//!
//! ```text
//! [4B body_len][1B version][1B kind][payload]
//! ```
//!
//! All integer fields are big-endian. `body_len` is the byte length of
//! `[version][kind][payload]`; it does not include the 4-byte `body_len` field.
//! The current version byte is `1`.
//!
//! Frame kinds:
//!
//! | Kind | Name     | Payload |
//! |------|----------|---------|
//! | 0x01 | hello    | empty |
//! | 0x02 | request  | `[2B message_id_len][message_id][4B payload_len][payload]` |
//! | 0x03 | response | `[2B message_id_len][message_id][1B status][2B diagnostic_len][diagnostic]` |
//!
//! Response status values:
//!
//! | Status | Name     | Meaning |
//! |--------|----------|---------|
//! | 0x00   | accepted | sink handled the request |
//! | 0x01   | rejected | sink understood the request but declined it |
//! | 0x02   | error    | sink failed while processing the request |
//! | 0x03   | queue-full | sink is temporarily full; caller may retry |
//!
//! ## Expected sequence
//!
//! ```text
//! vsock-guest: bind_abstract_listener -> accept_with_timeout -> read_hello
//! guest-agent:                         connect_abstract     -> write_hello
//! vsock-guest: write_request
//! guest-agent: read_request -> write_response
//! vsock-guest: read_response
//! ```
//!
//! The request and response exchange can repeat on the connected stream until
//! either endpoint closes it. Message ids are non-empty UTF-8 strings. Request
//! payloads are bounded by [`MAX_CONTROL_PAYLOAD_BYTES`], and response
//! diagnostics are bounded by [`MAX_DIAGNOSTIC_BYTES`].
