/**
 * Okou Harness base system prompt for the Pi loop.

 * The official base prompt names its own harness and links its own
 * documentation tree, neither of which describes the runtime Okou presents to
 * users. The loop replaces that base through the official resource loader's
 * `systemPrompt` input instead of appending to it, so the official builder
 * still contributes the append blocks, project context, skills, and the
 * working-directory line around this text.
 *
 * The tool sections are derived from the session's own active tool
 * definitions rather than restated here, so a tool whose snippet or guidelines
 * change upstream cannot silently drift out of the prompt.
