 * A row exists only once the analysis run publishes a finished package, so
 * there is no import lifecycle to store. The run's own chat thread is where
 * the user watches the analysis, and an abandoned analysis simply never
 * inserts.
 *
 * The compiled package is not referenced by a column: it is the storage named
 * `presentation-template@{id}`, derived from the row id the same way
 * `workflows` derives `custom-skill@{workflowId}`. One authoritative
 * location, nothing to keep in sync.
 *
 * `source_storage_key` and `page_keys` reference independently owned objects
 * created by the normal private upload route. URLs remain a read-time
 * decision. Array position is the page number and element 0 is the cover, so
 * the page count is `array_length(page_keys, 1)` and never a stored column.
 * The template commit resolves those uploads directly instead of registering
 * the page images as `run_uploaded_files`, which would project every slide
 * crop into the user's artifact catalog.
