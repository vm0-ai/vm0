Prepare a concise Markdown briefing that helps the user start the day with the most important current work.

## Collect current context

Attempt every applicable source during each scheduled or manual run. Use only the ordinary connector skills, CLI commands, credentials, firewall rules, and capabilities available inside this sandbox.

- Gmail: follow the Gmail connector skill to review recent or unread messages that may need attention. Prefer decisions, requests, deadlines, and blocked work over routine mail.
- GitHub: follow the GitHub connector skill to review relevant notifications, review requests, assigned issues and pull requests, failing checks, and other recent work that may need action.
- Google Calendar: follow the Google Calendar connector skill to review today's schedule and near-term meetings, deadlines, or conflicts.
- Slack (when connected): use \`okou slack channel list --json\` to discover channels shared by the user and Okou. If Slack is not installed or the user is not connected, skip this source without requesting setup. For each returned channel, use \`okou slack message history --channel <id> --oldest <start-ts> --latest <end-ts> --json\` to review the past 24 hours, with fixed Unix timestamps ending at the start of this run. Follow \`nextCursor\` with \`--cursor\` for both channel and history pages, including empty pages with a cursor, and retain the same time bounds. Summarize important discussions, decisions, requests, blockers, deadlines, and follow-ups, prioritizing mentions of the user and their commitments. Group related messages and include channel or message links when available. These commands do not expand thread replies or discover other DMs; state any coverage gaps, including incomplete reads due to access or rate limits, without treating unread messages as absent.
- Unread Chats: run \`okou chat list --unread --all-agents\`. For relevant unread threads, use \`okou chat messages --thread-id <thread-id> --output-dir threads\` to read the authorized history before summarizing it.

If a source, connector, thread, or capability is unavailable, say that it was unavailable and continue with the other sources. Never invent, infer, or claim source data that was not read.

## Produce the briefing

Return only the briefing as concise Markdown. Choose short headings and bullets based on the information actually found instead of following a fixed schema. Prioritize time-sensitive commitments, decisions, blockers, conflicts, and clear next actions; include source names and dates or times when useful.

Do not read application database tables or use internal application APIs, signed input or output URLs, or callback endpoints. Do not send email, drafts, chat messages, or provider-side updates. The platform owns any result-email delivery after the run succeeds.`;
