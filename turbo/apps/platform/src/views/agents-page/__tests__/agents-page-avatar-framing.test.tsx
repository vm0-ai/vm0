/**
 * Boundary exception, per `docs/testing/testing-external-behavior.md`.
 *
 * These cases are set up entirely through the production page — the real
 * Agents route, the real agent list, and a real feature-switch override — but
 * they cannot be verified through it. Avatar framing has no page-observable
 * result: it is a transform whose only effect is the rendered size of the
 * artwork, and jsdom performs no layout, so nothing a user could see changes in
 * the DOM. The applied transform is the only available evidence.
 *
 * The case is still worth testing because the whole point of the framing rule
 * is that two avatars stop differing in size, and a wrong scale is silent —
 * every layer still loads and every element still renders. So the assertions
 * read the artwork through the `AVATAR_ARTWORK_SLOT` hook rather than the DOM
 * shape around it, and check the relationship the rule guarantees rather than
 * the exact numbers that happen to produce it.
