# Artifact sharing

New-policy private artifacts use the existing `privateArtifacts` switch. Its
code default remains `false`. The API resolves the owner/original-org switch
for new grants and audience/version changes; the app uses the same switch for
its Share menu. Stored policy enforcement, organization resolution and stopping
an existing share do not depend on the rollout switch.

## User flow

The owner opens an artifact's existing Share menu, which contains only
**Share to organization** and **Share to Public**. Choosing either option shares
the displayed version and copies its link. If that version already has the
chosen audience, the action only copies the existing link without updating
permissions or republishing. Opening the menu is read-only. Upload, generation,
hosting and thread sharing create no artifact grants. Recipients cannot edit
or reshare.

- Organization: `https://app.okou.ai/share/artifacts/<shareId>` (the configured
  `APP_URL` in other environments). The app uses existing login with a same-origin
  return path, then calls the API with its session. The API checks the grant and
  current membership of the **original organization**, even when another org is
  active. Success navigates directly to the signed file or isolated HTML; this
  route adds no viewer or wrapper iframe. Denial shows only an unavailable
  message. The app handoff and API response are private/no-store and no-referrer.
- Public: `https://sh-<compactShareId>-<publicationToken>.okou.app/`, using the
  configured branded hosted domain. Anonymous requests go through the host
  Worker and never require an API or primary database round trip.
- The menu has no separate copy or stop-sharing action. The API retains its
  stop-sharing operation for revocation and rollback. Changing Public to
  organization clears the public token before acknowledging
  organization-only scope. Republishing rotates that token, so an earlier
  revoked public URL stays revoked.

A file ID is one version. A hosted site's share ID spans its versions, but its
policy pins one explicitly selected deployment. A new generation or another
`--site` upload does not update the share. Choosing an audience on a newer,
not-yet-shared version explicitly updates the selected version and copies the
link; the organization link stays stable. Repeating the action for the already
shared version only copies that link.
CLI/model URLs continue to be stable authenticated API references.

## Storage authority and immutable bytes

`artifact_shares` contains the durable owner, original org, brand and logical
file/site identity, with one row per target. It is an ownership index, not a
second mutable policy authority. The versioned R2 object at
`artifact-shares/<brand>/<shareId>.json` is the **single authoritative policy**:
owner, original org, selected version/snapshot, audience, active/revoked status
and current public token. The API validates its identity against the database
row; the Worker validates its schema, brand, share ID, state and public token.
Missing/invalid/unavailable policy never authorizes content.

Sharing first copies the selected bytes into private snapshot keys. File copies
stay in the private artifact bucket; HTML bundles stay in the hosted-sites
bucket under `shared-artifacts/<brand>/<snapshotId>/<deploymentId>`. No upload
credentials are issued for those keys. This prevents still-valid upload PUT
credentials from modifying already shared content. A snapshot is reused for
later audience changes to the same version. No public bucket or public alias is
created or updated; no thumbnail renderer or image-transform URL is introduced.

The identity is committed before publishing. Owner mutations serialize with a
row lock, copy all required objects, then write the authoritative R2 policy.
No grant is written if a copy fails. A successful response follows the R2 write;
R2 provides strongly consistent object reads and writes. Writes use `If-Match`
against the ETag from the same policy read, or `If-None-Match: *` for creation.
Every mutation includes a unique revision, preventing identical audience changes
from reusing an earlier validator. A delayed writer that loses its DB lock cannot
overwrite a newer acknowledged state; conditional-write failure returns an error
and requires reloading the current policy. There is no KV policy
replica or policy cache. If the connection/response fails after a write, the
client must reload sharing state; the write may already have applied. The next
status read uses the same R2 authority, so a failed DB commit cannot restore a
previous public scope. Failed copies can leave unreachable private snapshots.

## Delivery, caches and revocation

Organization resolution calls the existing Clerk infrastructure with the exact
original org and recipient user filter on **every resolve**. It bypasses the
60-second role cache, so no membership-cache TTL is added. The same fresh
membership check also protects owner management. The existing member
removal path still clears that role cache for other consumers. Clerk errors
fail closed. The API then issues a file signature or an isolated `ps-` HTML
preview credential lasting 15 minutes. Organization credentials are stored under
`shared-previews/`, separate from owner `private-previews/` credentials; changing
the hostname prefix cannot turn one into the other. HTML grants include the selected snapshot;
all HTML, CSS, JS, images, navigation and downloads use that isolated origin.
Normal app cookies/tokens never enter it. CSP disables workers/service workers.

Removal or stopping blocks subsequent organization resolution. Already-issued
file signatures and HTML origins are bearer capabilities: copies can still be
used until their expiry. Allow for an in-flight resolution plus the 15-minute
delivery lifetime; this is not instant revocation of issued credentials. Content
already downloaded or rendered cannot be recalled. Owner `pv-` previews remain
separate owner credentials with their existing lifetime.

Public delivery reads the authoritative policy before every content-cache lookup,
including HEAD and HTML assets. The policy includes routing/manifest data, so
there is no second manifest fetch on the public path. Only immutable content is
cached with Cloudflare Cache API, keyed by snapshot and resource. Responses sent
to browsers/downstream CDNs are private/no-store, requiring requests to re-enter
the Worker. A revoked token cannot use a warm content cache. Requests already
authorized and in flight can finish. Public state has no propagation TTL.

Public single-file delivery currently serves whole objects (the existing host
Worker does not implement Range delivery). Measure large media and native
browser downloads during rollout acceptance.

## Rollout and remaining acceptance

Deploy the additive migration and new API, host Worker bindings/code, app Worker
handoff headers and frontend before enabling a test cohort. The host Worker adds
bindings to the already-created `user-artifact-private-dev` / `-prod` buckets.
This PR does not change live infrastructure, credentials, CORS or activation.
The new `ps-` prefix and separate grant namespace ensure an older Worker cannot
serve an owner bundle in place of its shared snapshot. New links may be unavailable during a
mixed deployment; the non-GA switch stays off until all surfaces are ready.
Historical public objects, aliases and flag-off creation behavior are unchanged.

The issue remains open until full per-PR/staging acceptance and the controlled
warm P95 TTFB target (no more than 10 ms regression) pass. Measure single files
and HTML waterfalls, cold/warm authorization and cold/warm bytes separately,
and report client-observed P50/P95/P99 by region. Local Worker tests or CPU time
are not regional latency evidence. The PR pipeline currently does not deploy a
per-PR host Worker; exact-origin CORS, wildcard TLS/routing, native downloads and
all-cookie-blocked browser behavior require the corresponding dev deployment.

Retain follow-ups for private snapshot/expired-grant retention and lifecycle
cleanup, direct connector outputs, arbitrary hosted-asset ingestion by providers,
and the remaining derivative/consumer audit from #32492. Shared-thread consumers
keep their existing independent artifact authorization; sharing a thread does
not publish its private attachments. This change adds no organization-recipient
Drive export or editing authority.

## Local verification for slice 4

Targeted route tests use real HTTP handlers and PostgreSQL, with only storage
and Clerk mocked at their external boundaries. Browser verification uses the
actual host Worker with synthetic private R2 and Cache API storage in local
Chromium; it is not a staging App/API deployment.

With all cookies blocked, public content/resources, warm-cache revocation,
organization preview, direct/nested navigation and expiry denial passed. Native
CSV downloads were cancelled in the all-cookie-blocked and recording contexts. A control run allowing
first-party cookies while blocking third-party cookies confirmed that the
cross-site iframe could not write cookies, then successfully downloaded and
verified the CSV from the direct organization origin. Default-cookie downloads
also passed. Full staging, deployment routing and regional latency remain open.
