# CLI and Runner E2E Testing

## Scope

Deployed E2E tests exercise the product exactly through supported user-facing
entry points. The current suite covers:

- the packaged canonical `okou` binary through unauthenticated command-boundary
  smoke checks, including rejection of the retired executable name;
- Clerk-backed sign-up and sign-in through the platform-owned Auth v2 UI;
- onboarding, chat submission, runner dispatch, and the assistant result through
  the deployed web application;
- real Claude BYOK, vm0 built-in Codex, and vm0 built-in Pi execution, including
  public usage attribution;
- active-run cancellation through the public run and chat-events APIs;
- ordinary and empty chat attachments across continuation, plus runner-mounted
  workflow files and agent instructions;
- connector firewall placeholder and authentication behavior through the
  deployed preview API, runner, sandbox, and proxy.
- raw network protocol, DNS, connector diagnostic, browser classification, and
  opt-in body-capture telemetry through the deployed runner and public run API.

An E2E test must not call `/api/test/*`, mint a test-only API token, write the
database directly, or use an internal fixture endpoint to construct or inspect
state. Create state through the same product UI or supported public API that a
user would use.

If a behavior needs precise database state or an external-service mock, cover it
in an API integration test instead. API tests may mount the narrow fixture routes
they need by passing them explicitly to `setupApp({ routes })` or
`setupAppWithRoutes`. Test routes must never be added to the deployed `ROUTES`
registry.

## Test boundaries

Keep each layer focused:

- CLI smoke checks verify that the shipped package exposes the supported binary
  surface without authenticating.
- Browser E2E verifies third-party Clerk form integration.
- Playwright verifies the deployed product journey, including the real preview
  API and runner fleet.
- API integration tests own deterministic error cases, state matrices, provider
  mocks, and fixture-only setup.
- Crates tests own runner and sandbox behavior that does not require the product
  journey.

## Adding deployed E2E coverage

Before adding a case, verify that it:

- begins at a supported product entry point;
- creates prerequisites through product behavior;
- asserts user-visible output rather than internal rows or logs;
- uses unique user-visible names when parallel execution can collide;
- leaves cleanup to the product lifecycle or an idempotent public operation;
- does not depend on a route, credential, environment flag, or database table
  that exists only for tests.

When those constraints make a scenario impractical, place the scenario at the
API integration or crates layer rather than introducing a deployed test hook.

## Running runner E2E tests

The BATS files under `e2e/tests/03-runner` are CI-only and cannot be run from a
local checkout. They depend on temporary Clerk organizations and API tokens,
the pull request's deployed API and app previews, and the preview runner fleet
provisioned by the `cli-e2e-03-runner-*` jobs in `.github/workflows/turbo.yml`.
There is no supported local setup for those credentials and services.

Push runner E2E changes to a branch and use the pull request pipeline to run
and validate this suite. Do not treat a local `./e2e/run.sh` invocation as
validation for `03-runner`; running the script without file arguments also
selects the CI-only runner tests.

## Adding runner BATS tests

Runner BATS files live in `e2e/tests/03-runner`. They share the accounts and
public device-flow tokens prepared by the runner E2E workflow, then create and
clean up their own agents, threads, and connector connections through public
`/api/*` endpoints.

Name runner BATS files `run-tNN-<behavior>.bats`, using the next unused `NN`.
The number is a stable file identifier, not an execution order. Test titles
should describe behavior without repeating the file identifier.

The workflow also prepares dedicated real-Codex and real-Claude identities.
Use the Codex identity for vm0 built-in model billing coverage and the Claude
identity for BYOK coverage so provider policy and usage assertions remain
isolated. The shared mock-runner identity starts with `UTC` as its timezone.
Runner BATS must not mutate shared account-level preferences from parallel
shards. Coverage that needs mutable account-level state requires a dedicated
identity or a serialized lane.

Use a different organization-scoped connector slug in each file that can run in
parallel. Assert sandbox-visible output and vm0-owned telemetry; do not treat an
external provider's exact response status or body as the test oracle.

For active-run connector refresh cases, coordinate through a run-scoped output
message in the public chat-events API. Network telemetry is uploaded after the
run completes, so use it only as the final ordered policy assertion, not as a
live synchronization point.

Body capture must be enabled on the individual chat run. Do not mutate the
shared runner account's next-run capture preference: runner files execute in
parallel, so user-scoped mutable preferences are not isolated between shards.

The workflow discovers the checked-in BATS files, weighs each file by its test
count, and assigns whole files to at most twelve non-empty shards. New files are
included automatically. Keep setup and teardown self-contained within a file so
the shard planner can move it without introducing cross-file ordering.
