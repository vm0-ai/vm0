# Runner SSH authority API

The API slice (#32386) and [Runner execution](runner-ssh-execution.md) (#32387)
deliver SSH authority under #31932. The Runner consumes these routes through
generated private Rust DTOs. [Owner and Agent consumers](ssh-access.md), including
the CLI and management UI, were delivered by #32014 / PR #32722.

## Authority and secret handoff

Runner SSH endpoints accept only the official fleet Runner credential. A local Runner
PAT, browser session or guest token cannot resolve credentials or learn trust.
The request identifies a Run, connection and winning Runner process
(`runnerId`, `heartbeatGeneration`); it cannot supply owner, Agent, endpoint,
credentials or command. The shared fleet secret authenticates the fleet, not an
individual machine: the process identity is checked against the Run's immutable
winning claim. Protecting the fleet secret remains a trust assumption.

Each call joins the current running Run, session, currently visible Agent,
the Run user's SSH grant, exact user-owned connection and its credential.
Run, session, grant and host user/workspace identities must agree. The Agent
must belong to that workspace and be public or owned by the Run user; its
creator need not own the host. Shared Agents never use their creator's hosts
on another user's Run. The current `SshAccess` (`sshAccess`) feature switch must be enabled;
there is no additional staff-org gate.
SSH access depends on the user's current configuration and the Agent's current
grant, not how the Run started. All chat channels, workflow schedule/event
automations, delegated Agents, webhooks, SDK/non-chat and test Runs use the same
authority path. A chat thread or trigger metadata is not required; workflow
associations and retained historical Goal provenance add no eligibility gate.
The Goal lifecycle is retired; that provenance cannot create or resume work.
The session identifies the Agent without using chat-thread state as an authorization gate.
The switch defaults to enabled for staff organizations and disabled elsewhere;
explicit user overrides remain effective. This rollout default does not replace
authorization or expose credentials to local/PAT Runners.

`POST /api/runners/runs/:runId/ssh/resolve` takes:

```json
{
  "connectionId": "b1f329f0-8010-48fb-9884-f78c839b35bf",
  "runnerIdentity": {
    "runnerId": "08999e12-3b53-4206-8088-374f3c0f6a54",
    "heartbeatGeneration": 7
  }
}
```

HTTP 200 has `outcome: resolved` with host, port, username, generation,
nullable learnedHostKey, privateKey and nullable passphrase. Secret whitespace
is preserved. This response is private to the trusted Runner, never guest RPC
output, Run snapshots, checkpoints, logs or audit metadata. The response is
`Cache-Control: no-store`. Downstream code must not log the response or arbitrary
errors containing it.

Missing, hidden, revoked or ineligible references all produce HTTP 200 with
only `{"outcome":"unavailable"}`, before decryption. Invalid syntax is 400;
missing/invalid auth is 401; authenticated local Runner auth is 403. Broken DB,
KMS or stored local invariants remain server errors, not unavailable references.

Configuration, encrypted credentials and relational authority are captured in
one joined read, followed by the feature check. That authorized snapshot is an
in-flight handoff: revocation cannot retract a response already authorized.
Every later resolve checks again and sees committed rotation/deletion/revocation.
The Runner can reuse a successfully resolved snapshot and parsed key for the
current Run while Ably is connected; it does not resolve on every command. This
explicit application-owned retention is not HTTP/proxy caching.
KMS decryption runs outside transactions and row locks, so slow KMS does not
block owner edits or revocation. Resolve never writes a learned host key.

### Invalidation and accepted freshness

After a successful connection edit (including credential rotation), deletion or
explicit host-key reset, the API sends identifier-only `ssh-authority-invalidated`
messages on `runner-group:<group>` for affected running owner Runs. Payloads are
`{runId, connectionId}`; null `connectionId` means the whole Run. Recipient discovery
must not require a grant or connection row that the mutation may have deleted.
The Run-wide hook accepts an Agent scope. Explicit per-user Agent grant changes
use that scope; automatic visible-Agent authorization when creating the first
host invalidates the current user's active Runs. Discovery does not depend on
a surviving grant. Current Agent visibility is rechecked on live inventory and
actual resolve/pin calls; the accepted cache lifetime below remains unchanged.

Notices are sent after commit and before the request observes cancellation. A
failed publish is logged, not reported as failure of the already-committed edit.
The Runner only evicts local authority; it obtains any replacement from the API.
Before Ably readiness and during disconnect/failure it resolves per command,
clears cached entries on observed connection loss, and refills lazily after recovery.

There is no fixed TTL or periodic authorization poll. Missed publication or a
dropped subscriber message may leave previous configuration/credentials/grants
usable for the remainder of the Run, including after deletion/revocation. This
Run-lifetime stale-authority window is explicitly accepted; Ably is not a reliable
revocation protocol. Cached parsed keys remain bounded in process memory and are
retired on invalidation or Run teardown. Per-connection public-destination and
cryptographic proof/pin checks remain mandatory, and invalidation never authorizes
command replay or guarantees termination of a remote command already started.

## Atomic trust on first use

`POST /api/runners/runs/:runId/ssh/pin` additionally takes
`expectedGeneration` and `observedHostKey: {algorithm, fingerprint}`. The Runner
must first validate the server's key-exchange proof of possession, then pin
before sending authentication. This API cannot verify that network handshake.
Accepted identities are Ed25519, NIST P-256/P-384/P-521 ECDSA and RSA, with a
canonical unpadded SHA256 fingerprint. `ssh-rsa` identifies an RSA public key;
it does **not** select SHA-1 signatures. The Runner advertises and signs RSA-SHA2;
see the execution document's explicitly deferred russh host-proof algorithm
consistency limitation.

Pin first authorizes without locking. It then locks the owned connection row
used by owner edit/reset, rechecks current authority and rollout state after
any wait, and holds shared authority/credential row locks through the write.
No KMS or other external call occurs in that transaction. Unauthorized calls
do not acquire another owner's connection lock.

| Stored state                                       | Result                  | Mutation                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Unpinned, generation N equals expected             | `pinned`, N+1           | Learn key and increment once   |
| Same key, generation exactly expected+1            | `matched`               | None                           |
| Different key already pinned                       | `host_key_mismatch`     | None, regardless of generation |
| Any other generation, including integer exhaustion | `configuration_changed` | None                           |
| Current authority unavailable                      | `unavailable`           | None                           |

Concurrent identical first observations converge on one pin. A different key
never overwrites trust. Endpoint edits, credential edits and explicit reset
retain the existing generation semantics; stale observations cannot silently
repin. TOFU cannot prevent a first-use MITM, and resetting trust intentionally
reopens that first-use window.

## Diagnostic connection observations

`POST /api/runners/runs/:runId/ssh/observations` accepts the same connection and
winning Runner identity, plus `expectedGeneration`, UTC `observedAt` and nullable
`failureReason`. The allowlist covers credential parsing, destination/network,
host-key and authentication failures, plus pre-authentication protocol/timeouts.
Waiting for the first-use host-key pin API is an authority phase, not target
connection evidence; a deadline there preserves the command's `timed_out` result
without creating a host warning.
Null means host-key verification and SSH authentication succeeded, not command
success. No command, output, peer diagnostic, credential or arbitrary error text
is accepted. The strict guest/CLI outcome and inventory DTOs are unchanged.

The API applies the current Run, owner, Agent visibility/grant, feature and
winning-claim checks before locking the owned connection. It rechecks authority
under the same lock used by edits and pinning, then records only the exact current
generation. TOFU reporters use the post-pin generation. A single child row in
`ssh_connection_observations` retains the generation, observation time and code;
deletion cascades with the host. Within a generation, duplicate or older times
are ignored. Times more than 60 seconds ahead of the API clock are ignored.
Fleet timestamps provide best-effort diagnostic ordering, not a distributed
total order or an authorization freshness guarantee.

The outcome is `recorded`, `ignored` or `unavailable`. Owner reads use the separate
`GET /api/ssh/connections/observations`, returning only current-generation rows
for the authenticated user/workspace. Existing strict configuration and summary
responses are unchanged. Accepted failures and recovery from a failure publish
the owner-only `ssh:changed` notification; consecutive healthy observations do
not reload the UI. Reports never mutate configuration or invalidate Runner authority.

Runner reporting starts only after terminal delivery has been attempted and the
guest stream and execution admission have been released. The existing Run-owned
dispatch task awaits the report with a one-second limit. A separate process-wide
four-report semaphore uses nonwaiting admission; saturation drops the observation.
There is no retry, detached worker or unbounded queue. Reporting failure, old API
404s and shutdown cannot alter or replay the remote command. Shutdown can wait
up to the bounded report timeout; Run termination or revocation can reject an
otherwise valid late report. The existing credential cache and missed-Ably window
are unchanged.

## Deployment

The observation table and endpoints are additive. Old Runners and clients do not
use them and retain existing behavior. A new Runner treats an old API's missing
observation endpoint as a dropped diagnostic; a new App shows diagnostic status
unavailable without disabling configuration management. Migration precedes API
promotion. The staff-default switch configuration does not establish which
artifacts are currently deployed. See [deployment compatibility](deployment-compatibility.md)
and [guest RPC transport](runner-rpc-transport.md) for the cross-version boundaries.
